# Lusi Namatovu Foundation - Website Redesign Project

## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the source code and assets for the redesigned website of the **Lusi Namatovu Foundation**, a non-profit Community Based Organisation (CBO) operating in Rakai District, Uganda.

The primary goal of this project is to transform the foundation's existing basic informational web presence into a dynamic, engaging, and modern platform. The redesigned website aims to effectively communicate the foundation's expanded mission, facilitate greater community engagement, and ultimately help secure more support for their vital work.

**Client:** Lusi Namatovu Foundation
**Location:** Rakai District, Uganda
**Founded:** 2016 by Samuel Ssebandeke
**Registered as CBO:** 2017

## 2. Background & Expanded Mission

Initially, the Lusi Namatovu Foundation focused on assisting elderly individuals in need of shelter, food, medication, and care, particularly those without government or family support.

In recent years (around 2024), the foundation has **expanded its mission** to also include comprehensive support for **people with disabilities** in Rakai District. This group faces similar struggles of neglect, poverty, and isolation. The initiative to include disability support programs was notably led by Director Ssekitto Alex Kayanja, who brings personal experience and deep understanding to this cause.

The redesigned website reflects this crucial expansion, serving as a platform for both core beneficiary groups.
